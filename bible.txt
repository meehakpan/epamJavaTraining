For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified/
But the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us; for after He had said before
This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord:
I will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them.

knowing that you have a better and an enduring possession for yourselves in heaven.
Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward.

For you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise:
But we are not of those who draw back to perdition, but of those who believe to the saving of the soul.
